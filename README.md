# Weather-Data-Analysis

VBO Weather Station data is collected for every 10 minutes and updated in a text file in a row for each day. The first parameter is sequence number and it has no data to validate. Also the row which for which the first parameter starts with 102 has no data to plot. So those rows also be eliminated while plotting. Below are the parameters (separated by comma) in each row from second parameter.

1. Year
2. Day of the Year
3. Hour-min of the day (starting from 12:00 AM)
4. (Average) Air Temperature (in °C)
5. (Sample) Relative Humidity (in %)
6. (Average) Soil Temperature (in °C)
7. Average Air Pressure (in mbar)
8. Rainfall (in mm)
9. Minimum Wind Speed (in m/s)
10. Maximum Wind Speed (in m/s)
11. Average Wind Speed (in m/s)
12. (Sample) Wind Direction
13. Average Flux (KW/sq.meter)
14. Total Flux (MJ/sq.meter)
